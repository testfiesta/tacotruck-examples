# Demo Ruby Calculator

A simple Ruby calculator project that demonstrates basic arithmetic operations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 2.7 or higher
- Bundler

#### Install dependencies
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

## Running Tests

The project includes comprehensive tests for all calculator functions:

```bash
rake spec
```

Generate test reports with junit formatter:

```bash
bundle exec rspec --format documentation --format RspecJunitFormatter --out spec/reports/test-results.xml
```

This command:
- Uses the documentation formatter for detailed console output
- Generates JUnit XML reports for CI systems (like Jenkins or GitHub Actions)
- Saves test results to `spec/reports/test-results.xml`

## Project Structure

- `lib/` - Contains the calculator implementation
- `spec/` - Contains tests for the calculator
  - `spec/reports/` - Contains test reports generated by formatters

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
